LEARNING OUTCOMES

1. Identify the differences between C++ basic data types, select types appropriate to a purpose and
   select correct and appropriate C++ identifier names

2. Construct and use functions. Write correct function prototypes, definitions, and calls to the
   functions. Select the appropriate method to pass values or references. Differentiate between void
   and valued functions. Identify the scope of automatic, static and global variables.

3. Use correctly input/output methods for different data types and formats.

4. Properly use of if, if…else and switch decision making operators as well as select the appropriate
   type and implement the looping mechanisms for, while, and do…while.

5. Declare, initialize, and manipulate one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays. Use arrays as
   function parameters.

6. Use object oriented programming to write programs in C++.

7. Employ advanced programming procedures based on inheritance and polymorphism.

8. Apply overloading techniques to increase the performances of existing methods and classes.
